# Bookshelf

## Starting Up

The database of books can be found in a JSON-server. If you haven't already done so, install json-server:

`TO INSTALL: npm install -g json-server`

You can then start the json-server by running the following:

`TO START: json-server --watch db.json`

In a separate terminal tab, also run the following to start the frontend server:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Deliverables

<!-- 1. Fetch to `http://localhost:3005/books`. You should get a response that is an array of multiple book objects that look like this: -->
```
{ 
   "id": 1, 
   "title": "The Great Gatsby", 
   "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald", 
   "img": "https://mppl.org/wp-content/uploads/0-214x300.jpg" 
}
```

<!-- 2. Render a list of books that show the book title and book image in the Book List -->
<!-- 3. Clicking on a book in the Book List should add it to the Bookshelf -->
<!-- 4. Clicking on a book in the Bookshelf should remove it from the Bookshelf -->
<!-- 5. Create a controlled form that allows the user to add a book to the Book List (this should _NOT_ persist) -->
<!-- 6. BONUS: Each book can only be added to Bookshelf once (Bookshelf should not have duplicate books) -->
7. BONUS: Allow newly added books to persist (optimistic rendering or pessimistic rendering)

## Sample New Book Info
Here is some convenient sample info for you to use to add new books to the Book List with your form.
